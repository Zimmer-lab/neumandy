# From MATLAB To Python (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

Following utility is used to convert MATLAB data to a python readable format. It is specific to the output of the [Whole Brain Analyzer](https://github.com/Zimmer-lab/whole_brain_analyzer_MATLAB) which is a wbstruct.mat file with the variables containing the imaged neurons as continuous time series and the IDs of the neurons (e.g. AVA). 

### **How to use this tool:**

Execute wbstruct_converter.sh on the lisc cluster via 

```. wbstruct_converter.sh```

and follow the commands.

This will produce a RAW data .h5 file, without any additional preprocessing beyond what the MATLAB tracker did (i.e. delta F / F).


### **When to use this tool:**

* If the directory that contains all your recordings has following structure:

        +---Recording1
        |   +---Head
        |   |   +---Quant
        |   |   |       wbstruct.mat
        |   |   |       other
        |   +---Tail
        |   |   +---Quant
        |   |   |       wbstruct.mat
        |   |   |       other
        +---Recording2
        |   +---Head
        |   |   +---Quant
        |   |   |       wbstruct.mat
        |   |   |       other
        |   +---Tail
        |   |   +---Quant
        |   |   |       wbstruct.mat
        |   |   |       other

    
    If there are subdirectories in between it should not be a problem<br>
    Example 1: "\my_directory\Dataset1\Head\Quant\wbstruct.mat"<br>
    Example 2: "\my_directory\Cleaned_datasets\Dataset2\Control\Head\Quant\wbstruct.mat"<br>


* If each **wbstruct.mat** file contains the following variables:
    - "simple" (which holds cleaned copies of the raw data)
    - "deltaFOverF" (the normalized fluorescent values)
    - "ID1" (the IDs) 




*Note: Keep in mind that this has not been thoroughly tested and might not work for all cases. If you encounter any problems please open an issue.*

### Data Sources 

1) Immobilized Whole Brain Imaging Data from Kerem (see project/neurobiology/zimmer/Kerem_Uzel/Whole_brain_imaging/)
2) Immobilized Whole Brain Imaging Data from Rebecca (see project/neurobiology/zimmer/Rebecca) 

1 and 2 used the [whole brain analyzer ](https://github.com/Zimmer-lab/whole_brain_analyzer_MATLAB) to preprocess the raw data from multiple datasets. The resulting mat files are then converted to python readable formats, i. e. hdf5 files and/or a dictionary of pandas dataframes with the **wbstruct_converter** tool.
